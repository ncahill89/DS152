It does not establish causation.\nTwo variables, x and y, could be highly correlated because there is another variable, z, having an impact on both x and y.\n\nExample, we have not established that extra height causes bigger feet. In fact genetic factors cause both."

    "text": "Spurious Correlations\nA spurious correlation is a statistical relationship between two variables that appears to be meaningful but is actually caused by coincidence or the influence of a third (confounding) variable. This misleading association can arise due to random chance, indirect causation, or omitted variables.\nFor example, there may be a strong correlation between ice cream sales and drowning incidents, but this does not mean one causes the other. Instead, a third factor—hot weather—increases both ice cream sales and swimming activity, which in turn raises the risk of drowning.\nSpurious correlations can often be identified through deeper statistical analysis, such as controlling for confounding variables or using causal inference techniques.\nFind two correlated variables from: https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations.\nCreate a scatter plot and find the correlation."
